Open Enterprise Search Platform (OpenESP)
=========================================
Welcome to OpenESP, the Open Source Enterprise Search Platform.
The project aims to develop an Apache 2.0 licensed distro of Apache Solr.
With distro, we mean Solr as the core plus other components which are
frequently needed in an enterprise search setting.

We believe the next logical step in the Lucene/Solr "revolution" is to
bring to the masses a free, open distro which enables enterprises around
the globe to be up and running with searching their databases, file systems,
ECMs and other repositories within minutes after downloading OpenESP.

The project is initiated and sponsored by Cominvent AS (www.cominvent.com)
and lives on www.openesp.org and here on GitHub.

We adopt the Apache Software Foundation project develpment methodology:
 * The product is Apache 2.0 licensed
 * A PMC will be established (http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html)
 * The PMC nominates committers (http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html)
 * Contributors grant all Â© to the project
 * All users are invited to contribute in an open, transparent way
 * Bug fixes and features are accepted through GitHub mechanisms

In the initial phase the project will focus on:
 * Establishing a repository structure and build system
 * Adding a Tomcat instance with decent defaults
 * Adding Solr with initial config
 * Adding a node start/stop mechanism

In later phases we'll look at
 * Crawler integration
 * Manifold Connector Framework integration
 * Admin GUI
 * More
